Got the project to work by just fixing the issue I had before looking at your solution.

I really liked and fully understood the idea of doing all server activity on the server folder (daah) so I'll be doing those changes in a later version of my code. In this one I wanted to show what I did without looking at your version.

Thanks again for all your help, Dan! I'm super excited really to be here. h

As for the project, I'm logging to the console the state of the blockchain -along its validity- with every transaction, and I find it super cool to see each block with their transactions and after the block gets fulled, it makes me feel like Vitalik building Ethereum haha
